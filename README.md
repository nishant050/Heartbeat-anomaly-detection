# Time Series Anomaly Detection with LSTM Autoencoders in PyTorch

## Key takeaways:

LSTM Autoencoders effectively detect anomalies in time series data.
Tutorial steps:\
Data preparation: Load and preprocess ECG data for anomaly detection.\
Model building: Construct an LSTM Autoencoder using PyTorch.\
Training and evaluation: Train the model on normal heartbeats and evaluate its reconstruction accuracy.\
Threshold selection: Determine a threshold for anomaly detection based on reconstruction errors.\
Anomaly classification: Classify unseen examples as normal or anomalous using the trained model and threshold.\
## Key concepts:

Anomaly detection: Identifying rare or unusual events within data.\
Autoencoders: Neural networks that learn to reconstruct input data, often used for anomaly detection.\
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks: Specialized for handling sequential data like time series.\
Reconstruction error: Difference between original input and its reconstruction, used to identify anomalies.\
## Practical application:

ECG (Electrocardiogram) data: Used to detect abnormal heartbeats, indicating potential heart conditions.
## Additional notes:

Tutorial includes: Code examples and a Jupyter Notebook for hands-on practice.
Considerations:\
Data quality: Crucial for accurate anomaly detection.\
Threshold selection: Impacts sensitivity and specificity of anomaly detection.\
Domain expertise: Often valuable for interpreting results and contextualizing anomalies.\
